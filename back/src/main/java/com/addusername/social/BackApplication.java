/*
 * Also I disagree with the idea that services should be converting between dtos and entities.
 *  Once in a while you may find a need for a dto but it shouldnâ€™t be routine. For web applications
 *  that use JSP or thymeleaf you may be able to happily add entities as request attributes and 
 * let the template use them directly. If your controllers need to return JSON, you may be able to 
 * hook up a messageconverter to generate JSON directly from the entity or it may be better to have a dto.
 *  Try to keep the focus on implementing business functionality and avoid moving data from one kind of holder
 *   into a different kind of holder, because that kind of code is brittle and error-prone.
